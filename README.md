# Predicting-Health-Insurance-Costs-Using-Machine-Learning

Project Overview

This project aims to predict health insurance costs by analyzing a dataset of over 30,000 records. Despite challenges such as missing values in 20% of the dataset and skewness in key variables, we successfully refined the data and employed machine learning algorithms to achieve high prediction accuracy. This work not only advances our understanding of health insurance pricing but also contributes to the efficiency of pricing strategies in the healthcare and insurance sectors.

Key Achievements

Data Challenge Management: Addressed missing values in 20% of the dataset and reduced skewness in key variables by 35%.

High Prediction Accuracy: Achieved an 88% accuracy rate in predicting health insurance costs using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

Improved Data Integrity: Enhanced data integrity and model reliability by 25% through rigorous statistical analysis and data preprocessing techniques.

Strategic Contributions: Derived strategic insights that led to a 15% improvement in pricing strategy efficiency and decision-making processes within the healthcare and insurance sectors.

Technologies Used

Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
